# TreeBrush Demo



Here's the demo in action:

There are three main components:

A tree fractal animation builds a single layer of the tree when the 'draw level' button is pushed

Leaf nodes grow at the end of the tree branches around levels 13-14. My ambition is to have leaf nodes conform to physics bodies (a challenge considering that thousands of leaf nodes would clog up the physics collisions, dragging down fps)

A particle emitter layer simulates stars slowly twinkling and moving in the background
